# Project / Module: Front-End

## Goals for today
- Update the package.json so we can run "npm start" instead of "node server.js", making more faster to start the server


## Task completed
- Created all the Front-End (the index.html, bootstrap.html, css and front_AIUsage files), including the images (made by Gemini AI), the modules, form, footer, and practically all the features can be seen at first view of the page.


## Use of Gen AI
Moderated, mostly used for style than functionality, but I also asked for logic implementation of the forms (how is the format to do it and how can it be sent to an email when the user send the form) and ask AI to comment the index, bootstrap and server files so debbuging result much more easy.

Propmt:
"Can you comment this bootstrap file with a naturally-descriptive-first person style so debbuging can result much more easy to do?"

Result:
"I agree comment make codes much more easy to debug. Here is your 'bootstrap' file commented in a 'naturally-descriptive-first person style':" and it gave me the file commented.

Propmt:
"What are the best web styles (font family, colors and distribution of the page) for web pages related to eductaion like Khan Academy or Udemy?"

Result:
Summarizing, the AI gave me recommended fonts and many style features to implement in both CSS and Bootstrap files, so it can look like a modern-professional academic website.

## What i learned
- I've learned much more in YouTube channels than official documentation and college classes. Most part of my code is based on codes youtubers made while streaming about web application development. But because a streaming is public, I didn't steal their codes.



## Challenges
- The grid modules (I have to ask AI why can't the modules be on columns of three despite my CSS config), why certain elements of the page dissapeared while working on the bootstrap and index files, the form's aspect to not look like an 80's suspicious form, etc.


## Resources Used
- YouTube, Web class presentations, bootstrap documentation and AI recommendations



## Personal Reflection
- Front-End creation requires a LOT of time and memorization of usage of labels (more in bootstrap), is too much "talacha". But for Back-End, it requieres a LOT of logic and critical thinking to be effective and responsive. Front-end may be disfunctional but can look pretty (at first look), but a disfunctional back-end is useless back-end.

# Important
- Late devs logs creation so if there are blank spaces is because the late inclution of it.
