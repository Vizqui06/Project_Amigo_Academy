Use of AI in our Web Dev project:

Throughout the development of the project prototype, we’ve accepted Copilot’s autocompletion suggestions, reviewed what it implemented, and decided whether to keep them in our code or discard them.

We accepted some proposals, among them the most important was the introduction and development of the contact section (name, email, and message fields), as a technical support feature for the page and an extra touch to make it more engaging. The structure and logic were made by the team consulting the presentations, online resources and AI suggestions and autocompleted; despite we have some AI content in our project code, we have taken the responsability by understanding the structure and logic of the AI generated code.

The prompts used for the team are like:
Chat, how can I add a tab in my HTML code so that a list is centered on the page without setting text-align: center?
What changes do I need to make so that the page can be viewed well on both large screens (computers) and small screens (cell phones and tablets)?
What is Bootstrap and how can I implement it on my code?

Also, there are several sections that AI facilitated us to autocomplete by pressing tab. We could have make it by our own but, having the rest of the code ready to complete by pressing a key, how to refuse it?
